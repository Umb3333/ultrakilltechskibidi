            </div>
            <p>While still in a dash frame, jump immediately after hitting the dash button, 
            costing an extra point of stamina. 
            The height of a dash jump is lower than a normal jump but has significantly faster horizontal speed. 
            (It is important to note that this cannot be done when dashing while airborne. However, the jump can be done mid-air after dashing off the surface.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Slam storage</h3>
        <p>Perform a wall jump mid-Ground Slam (jump while V1 is flush against a wall mid-slam). V1 will be airborne with its normal movement speed, though still creating the "Slam" particles. In this state, V1 is storing the momentum of the Ground Slam (and can still ground slam enemies underneath). [[This basically just means you want to press slam AND jump while jumping off of a wall. Then press some kind of movement button like jumping or slide jumping (as listed below) right as you touch the ground.]] <br>
        <br>
        Slam Storage must be spent the moment V1 touches the ground, or else it will be wasted. Landing on a rocket will also waste slam storage. 
        <br>
        Jumping will give V1 an enormous boost of vertical speed, launching it into orbit; Slam Bouncing can be used to maintain this height. The jump height has a cap but it is still very high. 
        <br>

        <h3>Projectile Boost</h3>
        <p>Performing a Projectile Boost (see the previous link for more information) will provide a much weaker but marginally safer alternative to the Overpump or Malicious Boosts. 
            It can be useful against an individual Cerberus, acting both as a high-damage attack as well as a quick retreat. 
            It does 35 damage to the player. </p>
