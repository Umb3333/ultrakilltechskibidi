        <h4>Dash Jump</h4>
        <p>While still in a dash frame, jump immediately after hitting the dash button, costing an extra point of stamina. The height of a dash jump is lower than a normal jump but has significantly faster horizontal speed. (It is important to note that this cannot be done when dashing while airborne. However, the jump can be done mid-air after dashing off the surface.</p>
